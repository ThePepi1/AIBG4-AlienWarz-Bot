## Hackathon results (for those who are interested.)

Unfortunatly there was a bug. When our bot is dazed and we switch the direction of movement we are getting the current position of out bot from ```Player``` object localy named ```me``` but it was mistakenly called as a function, since the object itself is derived from ```GameState``` object using ```me()``` method. So during quarter finals our bot crashed.
